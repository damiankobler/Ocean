We plan to create a chatroom application where multiple users can chat with each other in one chatroom. To do this we want to use Elixir and probably the Phoenix Framework. We implement basic functionality like texting and sending images. The essential problem of a messaging application will be the group communication problem. When having implemented basic functionality we could imagine to implement further functions like having multiple chatrooms, implementing a search function or other functionalities.
